# Vlad Avramenko - personal homepage

There you'll find some information about me and some things that I'm interested in. The page in current state is made to test what i've learned about HTML, CSS and JS, so don't take it too seriously. WIP.

The project includes a small JS code to enable interactive elements such as:
1. Dark/Light mode toggle modifying the button text;
2. Show/hide section of the HTML document;
3. Render welcome message on the devTools console;

Other methods/enhancements used:
- BEM
- normalize.css
- Google Fonts
